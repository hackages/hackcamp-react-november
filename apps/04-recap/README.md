You can check the live version [here](https://vigilant-torvalds-b2ff91.netlify.com/)

### How can you achieve this?

#### There are multiple things to fix:

- Redux:
  - You need to create the 3 reducers and action creators
  - Create the root reducer
  - Wrap the app with a Provider
- Routing:
  - Wrap the app with a Router
  - Implement the required routes in the App component
  - There are some links missing in the app, you'll see them while fixing the app
- General logic
  - Some functionnalities are broken
  - You need to fetch the list of movies and put them in the store

There are a lot of comments present in the code, you can look for them for more guidance
